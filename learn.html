                        Varify generates several value at risk models with varying parameters; identifying the most accurate model.

                        <p>
                        Models which are successfully backtested ensure a high degree of reliability going forward, which is reflected by a low p-value result.

                        As a comparison, keep in mind, the Basel Accord allows up to 4 breaches over a sample size of 250 99th percentile VaRs which is the equivalent of a 38% p-value.
